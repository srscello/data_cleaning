The files in this repository are used to clean and modify the data for the activity monitoring to create a tidy data set that includes the mean (average) value of each of the selected measurements (features). The selected features were those values that were mean or standard deviation measurements.

#Files

- run_analysis.R: The R file used to analyze the data files and create the tidy data set
- tidy_data_summary.txt: The output file containing the average selected feature
                        values for each subject and activity
- codebook.md: The codebook that describes the data
